GRAPHVIZ(7)          Miscellaneous Information Manual         GRAPHVIZ(7)

NAME
       graphviz - rich set of graph drawing tools
                  丰富的作图工具集

SYNOPSIS
       This  manpage has been written to fulfil the need of a centralized
       documentation presenting all available tools in the graphviz pack‐
       age.
       这份手册包含了所有属于graphviz 的工具.

AVAILABLE TOOLS
   Graph layout programs(图布局程序)
       dot    filter for hierarchical layouts of graphs

       neato  filter for symmetric layouts of graphs

       twopi  filter for radial layouts of graphs

       circo  filter for circular layout of graphs

       fdp    filter for symmetric layouts of graphs

       All of the filters work with either directed or undirected graphs,
       though dot is typically used for directed  graphs  and  neato  for
       undirected graphs.  Note also that neato -n[2] can be used to ren‐
       der layouts produced by the other filters.
       所有的过滤器都可以用于生成有向图或者无向图.

AUTHOR
       This manual page was  written  by  Cyril  Brulebois  <cyril.brule‐
       bois@enst-bretagne.fr> in november 2006, based on an initial docu‐
       mentation effort by Joachim Berdal  Haga  <jbh@lupus.ig3.net>.  It
       can be distributed under the same terms as the graphviz package.
